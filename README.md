## **This is my quick starter kit for small projects**
You can use this repository to ***quickly start a small project***, in order to test an idea quickly or something like that.
Basically, it offers a nice little structure of files already in place with a *reset styleshee*t, and all you have to do is code :))

## **Hierarchy and use**
In the root of the project, there are familiar files like **index.html** that we don't need to introduce anymore, **index.js** that I use to make the dynamic side of my site and manage the other javascripts files, and **styles.css** to style the specific elements. 
The **assets** and **src** folders are described below:
- 📁 **assets**: to place logos, images, fonts, and other project media.
- 📁 **src**: to place all css style sheets, and scripts.
	- **css**: already contains a *_base.css* file to write the general css style rules, and a *_reset.css* file as a reset stylesheet, and I put my other stylesheets there.
	- **js**: this is where I put my other javascripts files that will be imported into *index.js*.
